# React + Vite

For this assignment i started by running the vite commands to build out the portfolio.

I made a components folder to store my footer, header and nav files these were then imported to the app.jsx.

For the pages folder i made an about, contact, portfolio and resume files, To build out each page I used bootstrap to find examples.
